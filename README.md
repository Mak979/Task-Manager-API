# Task-Manager-API
This project is built on NodeJs. I have used ExpressJs as the framework for all the middleware and backend configurations.
This project includes the basic CRUD operation for a task i.e Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting a task. 
I have used MongoDB atlas for the data persistence and Mongoose for the ORM part.
